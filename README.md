The patch demonstrates normalizing time (for exponential and polynomials/ splines shaping) w/ brute-force, which tough for real-time modulation may easily be proper method.\
It also has and option to slide time manualy (fake time) to check values and modulate real tiime - so changing Attack when time is running will re-adjust 0-1 normalization.\
Time is fixed to 100 just for testing/ showcasing..
